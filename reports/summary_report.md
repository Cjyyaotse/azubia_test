📊 Model Performance Overview
✅ Accuracy: 0.6329
What it means: The model correctly predicted ~63.3% of all test instances.

Caution: In imbalanced datasets, high accuracy can be misleading (e.g., predicting only the majority class).

🎯 Precision: 0.1998
What it means: Only ~20% of the positive predictions made by the model were actually correct.

Interpretation: A low precision indicates a high false positive rate — the model often predicts a customer will subscribe, but they're not likely to.

🔁 Recall: 0.7827
What it means: The model correctly identified ~78% of actual positive cases.

Strength: This is quite good — your model is catching most people who would subscribe.

Trade-off: It comes at the cost of many false positives (low precision).

📈 F1 Score: 0.3183
What it means: This is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

Interpretation: The F1 score is moderate because it's balancing your high recall and low precision.

🧪 ROC AUC: 0.7440
What it means: The model has a good ability to distinguish between classes overall.

Value range: 0.74 is a respectable score; anything over 0.70 generally indicates a useful model.

⚖️ Summary of Trade-offs
Metric	Value	Verdict
Accuracy	0.6329	Moderate
Precision	0.1998	Low – many false alarms
Recall	0.7827	High – catches most subs
F1 Score	0.3183	Moderate
ROC AUC	0.7440	Good – strong classifier

🧠 Suggestions to Improve:
Tune threshold (move away from 0.5) to balance precision & recall.

Try different classifiers: XGBoost, RandomForest with class weights.

Feature selection: Remove low-impact or noisy features.

Use probability calibration: To better estimate true likelihoods.

Ensemble models: Stack models for improved stability.
