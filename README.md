# 📈 Term Deposit Subscription Prediction

This project focuses on building a machine learning pipeline to predict whether a client will subscribe to a **bank term deposit**, supporting the marketing team's targeting strategy. Leveraging historical campaign data, the project applies data science workflows to generate actionable insights and a real-time prediction tool.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Predict client subscription to a term deposit (`y = "yes"` or `"no"`) based on demographic, behavioral, and campaign-related features.

---

## 🔄 Project Workflow

### 1. 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Explored data distributions, correlations, and patterns.
- Handled missing values and outliers.
- Scaled and transformed features for modeling readiness.

### 2. 🏗️ Feature Engineering

- One-hot encoded categorical variables.
- Generated derived features to improve predictive power.
- Selected top features contributing most to the target variable.

### 3. 🤖 Model Development

Trained and compared multiple classifiers:

- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost  

Final model chosen based on **ROC-AUC score**.

### 4. 📊 Model Evaluation

Evaluated performance using:

- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1 Score  
- ROC-AUC  

Addressed class imbalance with stratified sampling and appropriate metrics.

### 5. 📣 Insights & Recommendations

- Identified key features influencing subscription behavior.
- Suggested client segments for targeted marketing.
- Final model deployed in a user-friendly **Streamlit** app for real-time predictions.

## 🚀 Streamlit App Instructions

### Step 1: Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### Step 2: Run the app

```bash
streamlit run app/predict.py
```

This launches a web interface where you can input client data and receive live predictions.
